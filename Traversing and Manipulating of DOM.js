DOM represents html and xml like a tree structure
  Manipulating - creating,inserting and removing elements
  Traversing - selecting an elements from other elements

  Selecting of DOM elements
  1.getElementById()
  2.getElementsByClassName()
  3.getElementsByTagName()

  Direction of Traversing 
  1.Downloads

    b.children
  2.Upwards
    a.parentElement 
  3.Sideways
    a.nextElementSibling,
      previousElementSibling
    b.parentElement+children+index
